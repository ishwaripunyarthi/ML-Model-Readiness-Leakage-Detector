# ML-Model-Readiness-Leakage-Detector
ML Model Readiness & Temporal Leakage Detector

This application evaluates whether a machine learning model is safe
to deploy by comparing random-split and time-based performance.

Key checks:
- Temporal leakage detection
- Deployment risk scoring
- Real-world generalization assessment

Users upload a CSV dataset, select target and time columns,
and receive a deployment verdict.
